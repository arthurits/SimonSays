## How to play
The programm starts with a one tone-and-light sequence that the user has to repeat by pushing the corresponding buttons.
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

The program is highly costumizable (number of buttons, colors, sounds, et cetera), especially regarding the play modes which portray several levels of difficulty. These are:
* Simon classic: the player has to reproduce the sequence shown by Simon, increasing one button.
* Player adds: *not yet implemented*.
* Choose your color: *not yet implemented*.
* Simon bounce: the same as *Simon classic* but the buttons are randomized each time the user correctly reproduces the sequence.
* Simon surprise: all the buttons are colored red and reproduce the same sound.
* Simon rewind: requires the player to memorize and repeat the sequence backwards.
* Simon random: instead of adding one color/sound to the previous sequence, in *Simon random* each sequence is randomly created each time.
